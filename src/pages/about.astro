    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>
      This project is in it's infancy, nothing exists at the moment and
      everything is work in progress!
    </p>
    <h2>What is this project?</h2>
    <p>
      With this project we want to create an open source ecosystem of sim racing
      and flight hardware and software for enthusiasts that have the skills and
      are not willing to pay the high prices of commercial products.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to provide premade designs, software and documentation for
      people to build their own hardware and software for sim racing and flight
      simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also want to provide tools and knowledge for people to create their own
      designs and software.
    </p>
