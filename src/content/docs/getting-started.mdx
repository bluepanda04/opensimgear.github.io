## Intro

With this project we want to create an open source ecosystem of sim racing
and flight hardware and software for enthusiasts that have the skills and
are not willing to pay the high prices of commercial products.

Our goal is to provide premade designs, software and documentation for
people to build their own hardware and software for sim racing and flight
simulation.

We also want to provide tools and knowledge for people to create their own
designs and software.
