There are many way you can help, as a start:

- The project needs a logo/icon
- We need nice UX/UI design, I am a Full stack engineer but design and creativiy are not my forte
- We need to start building the knowledge base
- We need proper legal setup, privacy policy, terms of use, etc
- If you have ideas please get in touch via email <a href={`mailto:${config.contacts.info}`}>{config.contacts.info}</a>
