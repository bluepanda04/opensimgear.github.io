Hexapod, or Stewart platform mechanisms, find extensive application in precision engineering. The significant advantage lies in their parallel linkage, which connects all Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) from the moving platform to the base. This configuration often results in a notably stiffer and more compact design compared to traditional mechanisms, where DOFs are typically arranged sequentially.
